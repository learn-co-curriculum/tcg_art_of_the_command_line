# The Art of Command Line

## Learning Goals

- Use the command line and Unix tools to solve problems on systems

## Introduction

Read [The Art of Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/blob/master/README.md). In reality, reading this doc will entail reading many other documents - it's more a list of other tools to go and learn about.

If you are on a mac and find the unix commands don't work on your machine, you can ssh into a remote machine where the commands will work. Hint: your deployed heroku applications run some version of linux, so you can `heroku run bash -a hidden-harbor-84512` (with whatever your application is called). To see a list of your deployed applications, `heroku apps`.
